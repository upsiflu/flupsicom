                <p> It's spring 2021 already, and I've spent the windy days with the cyberfeminists of the early 90s. At
                some point, a recurring figure struck me: the SHELL, embodiment of the abutting surfaces that carry the
                imaginaries. </p>

                <p style="color:cyan"> Your feet may be on a ground somewhere on this planet, but your hands reach halfway
                into cyberspace. Or the other way around. Are you comfortable? How would you like to live, which beings
                to share these minutes with? </p>

                    <p>Can't I do the good work? What's this bugging pain? I want to live on a boat under a willow-tent, I
                    want to read one page per day, I want a deep conversation per day, eat a bouquet of flowers and
                    colors, drink tea and coffee, move through the dim, prospective air of dreams. I want to take a dip
                    and melt, then reassemble myself in the harsh breeze; again and again, day for day, season for
                    season. Summer, whose promise, or imagined promise, is too large to bear, cruel you, give me the
                    courage to fall!</p>
                    <p>There you are, scent of budding, earthworm, virtuoso of harpsicord and trombone. I thought you were
                    gone. You should have gone for I was horrible. But perhaps you don't mind so much? You like this
                    place? And your comrades, they're here as well? How fabulous, how delightful!</p>
                    <p>I want to play the instruments with you. Or listen. I want to sing to you and cry. I want you close
                    or distant. In silent appreciation or disdain. I want all of you close or distant, I want to know if
                    I want you close or distant. I want to tell you in clear and calm words, now is the time for me, and
                    I want you to tell me, or to tell each other with our bodies, or with the closing note.</p>
                    <p>I miss you.</p>
                    <p>I miss you so dearly, but am I missing the imaginary memories I created, that I composed out of
                    helplessness and self-sorrow once, out of the vapors of warm soil, the moist, infested shade behind
                    a straw bale? Am I missing a second hand or third hand memory or caricature thereof?</p>
                    <p>We take a walk on the cloud that is mist over the morning river, our feet dissolving. I want to
                    freeze and to evaporate. I want my skin to be the portal of your anger and your hope. I want the
                    path to open once a year to let a stranger in, but only if they know what I don't know. Don't tell
                    me about the systems some guru has told you about. No, I want to admire how every limb of your body
                    moves with the swells of mood and temperature. I want your four liquids all over the place. I want
                    your grace and earnesty.</p>
                    <p>I know you. The better I know me I know you. I know us. We are many. I know it's a small step from
                    the cubicle to the vast, open. We are connected. I am feeling the umbilical channel ring like a
                    phone line. Knock, and I'm scared to accept.</p>
                    <p>Help me accept. Wind, help me accept and trust that I can deny when I need to. Sun, help me stay
                    where I am and go where I go. Help me channel my anger, my radiant, sound, manifest rage, into
                    beauty for I am one beautiful beast as my naked feet are dancing on the dry planks over mud and
                    puddles. Ocean, give me the salty drops that heal my pain. Let it rain on me to make my skin
                    transparent. Embrace my clay-made, readymade, multiple body to exchange the heat and soften the
                    form. Dust, injure my eyes so that I listen. Make me stiff and long so that I forget the dragon in
                    my womb.</p>

                        <li> Arrival </li>
                        <li> Warm-up: Shaking. While shaking, in quick succession: impossible-scores, fantasy-names, mime-masks, sense-or-ship, massaging-the-floor-by-surprise, landscape-painting, proximity-layers, positional-voicing, chimera-embodiment, becoming-sand-and-moss.</li>
                        <li>Teatime (also eating raw kale and parsleyroots if desired)</li>
                        <li>Making-a-wish round, then suspending knowledge (and placing it temporarily on the window-sills)</li>
                        <li>Trying out how to know-with (together, we will create and populate a little toolbox)</li>
                        <li> Smoking Break (or just going out and having some air)</li>

                    <ol style="list-style: inside;">
                        <li> I'm really bad at recapitulating something I read a few years ago because everything becomes quite a soup in my mind, so I require you to bring your own idea of the words hegemony, binary, glitch, and the like. Just any understanding, perhaps opposite of mine, perhaps a fantasy, your imagination of what they could mean, why not. </li>
                        <li> Be prepared to suspend what you know about things. I will invite you to leave bits and pieces of your knowledge on one of the window-sills, and will remind you to take them back if you still need them after the workshop.</li>
                        <li> Put your body into and out of the Shells: Our practive may entail experimenting with unconventional Shells, alternative virtual and physical avatars that mask your body. Reflect your limits and boundaries, decide when and where (and whether) to shift them. All exercises will be voluntary and on your initiative, so be prepared to articulate your needs and desires, verbally or nonverbally, and to engage with others' needs and desires.</li>
                        <li> Co-create an environment of mutual support, listening and awareness where all the above becomes possible.</li>

            to the pictures. Since I'm usually undecided, I leave you the choice whether you want to go chronologically,
            thematically or associatively. As I love arbitrary-but-insistent schemes of classification, I came up with a
            trifecta of themes that can be found in the stuff I was concerned with, ca. 2011-19. These are: </p>
            <ul style="color:coral">
                <li>• approaching dance as economy, or economy as dance</li>
                <li>• a collection of extended pleasure techniques</li>
                <li>• taking "empty" spaces as sites of yet-untold stories.</li>

            memory, a dumpyard of unfinished and half-connected bites. Enjoy, my heart, and let me know when you need

                <h1>end of images</h1>
                <p>The corpus presented here starts with the end of images. What is left to do if all new images are doomed
                to turn out as replicas of previous images? If everything you see just tells the same old myth again?
            </p>
                <p>This is where I found myself around 2013, and looking back today, I can discern three approaches I would
                try. First, dreaming into the figures of abandoned spaces, and taking a site as <em>myth container</em>.
                Voids filled with imaginary societies and the peculiar became self-evident. I sense the traction of
                alternative myths.</p>
                <p>Second, to empty the situation of all signs, to dance without knowledge, to let my belly guide. In small
                groups, exploration of our <em>machine pleasures</em>, untainted from hypertrophic subjectivity, would
                reopen our attention to materiality and mutuality, and enable encounter: as an unconditional gift. We
                let ourselves fall into figures from a world without violence.</p>
                <p>Third, where is the knowledge of <em>that</em> world? Which economy is without violence? What language
                will post-patriarchy speak? Reading D.A. Haraway’s cyborg manifesto and Silvia Federici’s
                economy-history of body inscriptions as <em>scores</em>, in several collaborative projects I put
                together a toolbox of rituals, narratives and practices that may help us dance cyborgs' liminal spaces
                into our realities: <em>dancing economy</em>.</p>

            <h1>process companionship</h1>
            <p>Since dance became my life, I am accompanying performance and dance projects. As a process companion, I
                help with writing, critique, framing, and creative decisions, contribute my experience with
                collaborative work, and propose fruitful approaches to develop artistic material.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Contact me if you have a process going and need an outside ear/eye/heart! I’m usually available for a
                    spontaneous, free coffee.</em>
            </p>
            <p style="background: coral; padding: 1em;">
                <strong style="color: coral; background: black;">price structure:</strong> My hourly price is 0.1% of
                your private property. If you have negative capital (debt), I will pay you. Sometimes I can offer free
                service, just ask. I'm also more than happy to share with you our means of production, e.g. camera,
                computer, knowledge, servers, bodies, taste.
            </p>
            <p>And this is what I can offer you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Translation (en/de/fr).</h3>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Writing.</h3>
                    <p>I can help you with grantwriting (Berlin/Germany/Europe), storytelling, redaction, rhetorics, and
                        proper text formatting. Yes, I can be quite anal :-)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Artistic Research.</h3>
                    <p>Know your sources. Know your material, and know your options of representing it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Framing and Critique. </h3>
                    <p>Together we can get to understand: what context do you place your work in? &nbsp;Which
                        institutions are you affirming or subverting? Which discourses will you leverage, and what is
                        your own stance within or in opposition to these frames? How exactly is your work political, and
                        where is your position in the many contemporary social struggles?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Light, stage and costume making.</h3>
                    <p>Due to my experience in children’s theatre, performance, and no-budget filmmaking, I can support
                        you with video, sound and projection, color, lights, building structures, materials, props and
                        costumes. What you need for an impressive production is not stuff but devotion and time. I’m
                        especially interested in reusing accessible and free material, minimal effort for maximum
                        impact, and I’ll share lots of low-budget tricks with your team.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Videomaking, editing and postproduction.</h3>
                    <p>With a ‘dancing camera’, we can capture volatile moments. Publish beautiful trailers and clips
                        for videodanza festivals or global youtube/twitter/vimeo... audiences. I can offer camerawork,
                        sound/foley/voiceover recording, collaborative editing, color grading, 3D animation and effects
                        compositing, subtitling, and publishing on social networks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Internets.</h3>
                    <p>The web offers unprecedented resources for connections and realtime collaboration on a global
                        scale. Let’s leverage the virtual realms for team communications, documentation, archiving, PR,
                        or crowdsourcing. Since 2007, I have been creating content management systems and published
                        artists’ portfolios, blogs and apps to the internet. We can find a suitable strategy for your
                        project that won’t strain your limited resources.</p>

                        <p>In <em>tableaux vivants</em>, ‘living images’, actors represent a concept through staging a scenic figure
                taken from a known text. It fell out of use amidst the onset of industrialization due to a somewhat
                ribald excess: a body is always more than what it supposedly marks. In particular, excessive pleasures
                may transcend narrative frames and bear yet-unwritten myths from the cyborg worlds. A gallery exhibition
                with the working title «tableau vivant» is afoot, based on my graduation work «solo for my body» (July
                17, ‘18)</p>

                    <p> An ephemeral artwork is the product of artistic labour that ceases to exist some time after the labour.
                The relation between the art industry and ephemerality is peculiar as an ephemeral artwork is hard to
                commodify. Oral histories, documentation and theatrical reenactment are strategies to keep an ephemeral
                artwork's aura, i.e. its impact on the sphere of symbolic capital, and thereby retaining the principles
                of authorship and private property. Embodied memory functions as the medium by which a dance-work is
                preserved in such a way that it can be restaged. This makes the dancer's body literally a currency. </p>
                    <p> On the other hand, forgetting and unlearning, false memories, ageing and physical processes in the body
                transform the artwork. And when an artist is performing for the now, is not every reenactment and every
                memory a different artwork in a different context? </p>
                    <p> My collection of ephemeral artworks attempts to undo the aura and highlight the actual work, the labour
                that produces an ephemeral artwork. Read it as a contribution to an economy not based on conditional
                exchange and conventional evaluation but on the uncountable appreciation of lifetime and engagement.

                    <h1>performing economies</h1>
                    <p>Economies of space underlie every choreography. Bodies serve as currency and token in economies of
                representation. And finally, art is a market in which I am a freelancer.</p>
                    <p>During the «sand residency» in July ‘18, Pauline, Dorota and me explored the mutualities that emerge
                within an improvised dance. Several workshops throughout June have produced a comprehensive codex of
                practices.</p>
                    <p>The collective research project «allegory of economy» (December ‘17, ongoing) aims to leverage allegory
                as a tool to understand and reassemble economies in relation to bodies, transactions and customs</p>
                    <p>«future witchcraft» (feb-dec ‘17) comprised of a residency with an open lab, several performances and
                rituals, workshops and a theatre play, all approaching the political struggles of early modern women in
                Europe that ended, as we all know, in mass gynocides. Can we, in our situation, join these witches’
                emancipatory stategies of magic practice, ritual, and direct action, and eventually undo the historic
                establishment of female gender as economic marker?</p>
                    <p>Through the «framing ritual» (Jun 9, ‘17), I related the apparatus’ frame (such as central perspective)
                through spontaneous gestures and inscriptions (lines painted on skin) to inner foci, in an attempt to
                exclude conventional interprlay between these three layers. The awareness of five foci in the body which
                mold the appreciation of surroundings proved a useful ingredient for all successive practices.</p>
                    <h3 class="caption">Can dance crack codes of deprivation?</h3>
                    <p>“This is the first discovery: that patriarchy is not a construction, an order or a structure, but an
                economy, for which women are the first and founding commodities”, Sadie Plant writes in her essay «On
                the matrix: cyberfeminist simulations». And then she quotes Luce Irigaray: In this economy, “Women,
                signs, commodities, and currency always pass from one man to another”; their existance being reduced to
                what it signifies: “the possibility of mediation. transaction, transition, transference”. And adds:
                “Women have served as his media and interfaces, muses and messengers, currenties and screens,
                interactions, operators, decoders, secretaries… they have been man’s go-betweens, the in-betweens,
                taking his message, bearing his children, and passing his genetic code.”</p>
                    <p>In retrospect, allegories and emblems of the early modern age are blatantly sexist, and nescessarily so
                as they were to depict interfaces of circulation as female-marked bodies. The project of gendering the
                symbolic realm, a foundational effort of modern patriarchy, has, despite resistance from women, been
                successful, and continues to inform image production in the contemporary fields. And, in a
                not-⁠so-⁠ironic reappropriation, “Twentieth-century scientists call on this earlier visual technology
                for insisting on a specific kind of reality, which readily makes today’s observers forget the
                conditions, apparatuses and histories of its production. Especially in computer an information sciences
                and in biotechnology and biomedicine, representations of late twentieth century technosciences make
                liberal use of iconic exemplars of early modern European art/humanism/technology. Current images of
                technoscience quote, point to, and otherwise evoke a small, conventional, potent stock of Renaissance
                visual analogues, which provide a legitimate lineage and origin story for technical revolutions at the
                end of the Second Christian Millenium”, as Donna J. Haraway describes in her «Virtual Speculum». Deeper
                motivations may have stayed the same for 500 years as the extended-shelf-life visual apparatus canonized
                in the Renaissance still, in distinct ways, serves the production and reproduction of gender.</p>
                    <p>The visible spill of early modern emblems into cyber-⁠science throughout the 90s has inspired me to
                revisit contemporary body representation through the lens of Allegory. I discovered this word in many
                critical texts on 20th century feminist performance art as well as on early modern construction of
                gender, and despite its demise in the 19th century, Walter Benjamin’s seminal essay on Allegory seems to
                have spurred a slow but lasting reassessment of this concept throughout late modernity right into post
                modernism. Allegory, with its ternary structure and its figure’s superfluity, helps uncover myths that
                contemporary symbols would keep implied.</p>
                    <p>Economy is the other side of the model I work with, and it appears in three guises. First, as the
                circulation mediated by the figure-as-sign. Rebecca Schneider, in «The Explicit body», asserts that
                female-marked bodies in capitalism serve as “allegory for commodity circulation”, and to form the
                ternary structure of allegory, the text in this case is the ‘dreamscapes’ of ‘insatiable desire’, an
                economy itself, in which touch is impossible and gaze is infinite. Second, economy is instrinsic to my
                process of working, where resources, transactions and symbolic evaluation determine what I can produce.
                And third, the volatile space I summon through performance/dance is itself structured by an economy of
                bodies-⁠as-⁠material, even before any score is noted.</p>
                    <p>Allegory is a model to scutinize and construct approaches to alterity, i.e. what T. W. Adorno called
                ‘mimesis’. The explication of code/myth as requisite allows for normative assessment. It allows me to
                create images without conceding my judgement to the seductive affirmativity of the symbol, and it
                potentially gives the Other a language.</p>

                    <p>genet, the <em>gift economy network</em>, is a garden of knowledge. It is a virtual space in which each
                avatar (a group of users, an individual, or a bot) is invited to plant their compositions. Paths from
                one space to another are not generated by algorithms but by curatorial activity of the avatars, i.e. by
                invitation. Virtual spaces are the commons of the present and the future, and they may serve an
                invaluable role in facilitating the enormous logistical challenge of distributing goods for everyone,
                thereby replacing capitalist ways of structuring access.</p>

                    <p>In its current form, the interface to genet allows avatars to compose and edit collaboratively. In
                contrast to any other content management system, it bases its ontologies on a language derived from
                dance improvisation practices. In fact, any program written in <em>ambilang</em> is an easy-to-grasp
                score for a dance improvisation jam.</p>
                    <p>In my experience, the hardest errors in computer programming arise once the implementors are no longer
                sure about what the program is actually doing, i.e. when they give up understanding of the model that
                their software realizes. In this case, dancing this model makes the software tangible again.</p>

                    <section class="overview">
                        <p>The framing ritual was part of 2017's future witchcraft series of experiments (July, with 12
                    participants and 4 preparational workshops). My questions are: 1) can the 'framing' of the body
                    through visible lines make our motivations more transparent? 2) How does this 'inscription'
                    (Federici) relate to patriarchal inscriptions such as ableism, gender, skin color?</p>

                    shake, then find a common voice. Go play around the space. If you feel a part of your body becomes
                    active, go to the painting spot and let someone paint this part with a golden line. If a body part
                    becomes less active, remove the line. I found my centers around the ankles, the sacrum, the belly,
                    the lower end of the lungs, and around the clavicle bones and shoulders. Can be different for you.

                <h1>machine pleasures</h1>
                <p>In «tableaux vivants», ‘living images’, actors represent a concept through staging a scenic figure taken
                from a known text. It fell out of use amidst the onset of industrialization due to a somewhat ribald
                excess: a body is always more than what it supposedly marks. In particular, excessive pleasures may
                transcend narrative frames and bear yet-unwritten myths from the cyborg worlds. My graduation work «solo
                for my body» (July 17, ‘18) assaied the concept. </p>
                <p>«machine skills» was a workshop performance I gave in several frames. Tackling D.A. Haraway’s enigmatic
                assurance that “intense pleasures” were to arise from “machine skills”, I created a garden for cyborgs,
                and invited the participants to embark on counterpoint singing, affirming they have the according
                skills. </p>
                <p>The «cyborgism» practice was the result of my first interpretation of Haraway’s Cyborg Manifesto as a
                choreographic score. In several workshops and jams, the guests explored the pleasurable implications of
                being a cyborg in a shared space. </p>
                <p>How would a cyborg perceive and engage the material world? Sensations of touch and gravity guided the
                «moss residency» with dancer/artist Pauline Payen that comprised of somatic practice as well as felting
                interfaces, and talking about our economic situations. </p>
                <p>An aspect of cyborgs’ spacial economy is how we perceive limits. In recurring «limit jams», the invitees
                explored resistance and presence through malleable, contracting and expanding boundaries with tools from
                meditation, contact improvisation and martial arts. </p>
                <p>The touch of material became very visceral when rain was pouring during the participative installation of
                «river species», part of the «future witchcraft» series of events. </p>
                <p>«my stillness with the garden», a technique for grounding and preceiving everything as material began to
                develop in early ‘16 within ritual retreats I organized on the basis of Starhawk’s emancipatory
                witchcraft writings. </p>
                <p>Throughout summer ‘14, I met with three fellow artists to move like animals. We called ourselves the
                «crawling group». What started as a development process towards the production of a butoh-inspired
                performance, eventually became a deep dive into an alternative way of encounter, with both the
                environment and each other.</p>

                <h1>myth container</h1>
                <p>What I call <em>myth container</em> («Fabelcontainer», ‘12-⁠13) is a site-⁠as-⁠figure. Armed with the
                hieroglyphic fragments of an abandoned, or counterfeit discourse (they are always latent), we can enter
                this site-⁠as-⁠figure and practice the dislocation of our dance into a parallel world. Historical
                discourses depend on models of societies, and, in retrospect, evoke fascinating myths, stories within
                ideal societies. I stumble upon heterostopies, sites that are both what they are, i.e. material, and
                ideal, as if they were hosting imaginary parties of societies in a parallel world. This nourishing
                relation is mutual; the choice of a site juxtaposed with an abandoned discourse produces an ideal
                society, and in many ways this production covertly mirrors allegorese (allegorical interpretation),
                where a vessel that is more than its function, the figure of the body as marked by gender and other
                attributes, invokes meaning through a conventional myth. Conclusively, just as we commonly dance to
                produce a volatile space, through latent narratives, the volatility of a space arouses a dance in
                return.</p>
                <p>The expression ‘double in a parallel world’, liberally borrowed from Alice Chauchat, may grasp a
                grounding concept in several of my works. Those include the theatre script «K-⁠Gruppen» set in a looping
                1972 election night shifting between ‘limits to growth’, radical agit-⁠prop, and cyberneticized popular
                front politics (‘13), as well as the «Luftschiff» and «Architecten» narratives (with related works since
                ‘13) which are both set in a never-⁠ending WWI in Europe in the years 1917 resp. 1999, and inspired by
                the heterotopicity I experiences in the film-⁠sets I had been working in. In the context of my Fine Arts
                studies occured the ‘democratic pleasury’ («ein demokratischer Lustgarten»; ‘16-⁠17) and the precursury
                19th-⁠century «Akademie» world (‘12-⁠13), both inspired by Prussian garden architecture, which would
                later inform my practical approaches to an aesthetic of Tableau Vivant. The «Sociétés in the city
                without environs», finally, took the epinymous space not as figure but as rhetorical means to the end of
                informing a volatile space in which we’d find our ‘Other’, in Lacanian terms. Finding one’s double in
                these parallel societies nescessarily incurs a surrender towards fragments of a theory ethic-⁠esthetic,
                orphaned discourse looking for its debaters. Joy lies in connecting these pieces, mending the fissures,
                still failing a nod towards history’s actual tale, to create an iridescent mosaic. The latter’s mimetic
                like(li)ness and spatial fidelity to the architectural sediment (as in ‘take the hyroglyph for text’)
                carries a promise, a gesture of deference to normative reality effects, and this gesture is what I am
                trying to cultivate in all my projects.</p>
                <p id="luftschiff">«Luftschiff» and «Architecten», as well as the «Akademie» and «Lustgarten» take place in
                a fictional socialist Europe that has never embraced the steam engine. While the latter two are situated
                in a stratified but affluent late (and long) 19th century, the airship in «Luftschiff» crosses the
                Baltic sea in 1917, and hosts the author of a fiction, «Architecten», that projects WWI up int the year
                ‘99, including a slimy communications network based on biotech. The paradigmatic topos from which
                discourses evolve is that of neoclassical sculpture. The European discourses of rationality, humanism
                and misogyny find a lasting expression in gardens with statues, especially of the ‘pleasury’ variety. A
                21st century European may find it hard to reconcile masculinist Enlightenment rhetoric with the tactile
                qualities of Baroque and Classicist sculpture, in which the human figure poses as some mythical
                emanation. The unease is caused by the ‘too-⁠much’ that Walter Benjamin ascribes to (Baroque)
                allegorical figure. Classical and neoclassical aesthetics petrify allegory to an unbearable extent
                during the ‘Sattelzeit’ (early 19th century). This conflict warrants a nonfactual scenario, in which the
                early modern forms around allegory would have been rescued into modernity. How would the first modern
                world war be staged through this hypothetical setup? Which art corresponds to a society that perpetually
                reperforms long-⁠forgotten antique myths? Very likely, we may develop a sensibility for the history of
                that world in our’s—after all, has the early modern age in Europe ever ended?</p>

                <p id="societes">In «Sociétés in the city without environs» (‘14-15), the myth begins with the endlessness
                of a periphery (the site), and the self-⁠sufficiency of local secret societies (the hypothetical
                discourse), and then asks the site for fragments of a text. Which is the practice, or ritual, that a
                ‘city without environs’ lends itself to? The paradigmatic sprawl speaks of urban-⁠social indifference.
                How would the Sociétés ‘other’ each other? Through a compartmentalization: a history of labyrinthine
                entrenchment through an infinite, malleable concrete fabric, etc. Our performative explorations into the
                «Sociétés in the city without environs» started with bygone spaces rhetorically appropriated in order to
                summon the double of our troupe in another world, such as the (re)constructed labyrinth as synecdoche,
                or the abandoned Iraqui embassy building taken as metonym for the «bureaucracie».</p>

                <p>The site-⁠as-⁠figure in an allegorical equation is a device I find myself using all the time. But
                similarly, the solutions to the equations are developing their own lives as inquiry devices: they
                illuminate the contingency of today’s specific patriarchy. As they intergrow, their shared world, a
                ‘parallel’, raises issues of our’s. This is the cradle in which my inquiries in ‘18—«allegory of
                economy», «my stillness with the garden», and the performances around «cyborgism» and «machine
                pleasures»—would form: they are all questions that other world poses us.</p>

                    <p>As a freelance artist, I am economically dependent on the goodwill of those who own more than they

                    course, the customers of my services. Some of which think they can opt out of a contract after the

                    <p>As a freelance artist, I work for free. I connect with fellow artists to write huge applications. But
                    I don’t want to write CVs and Begging E-Mails and pseudophilosophical nonsense around a good idea.
                    Not if it’s not remunerated. I want to go out and do. </p>
                    <p>As a freelance artist, I connect my several websites and social media accounts and media servers and
                    struggle to keep everything up to date. But I don’t want to manage an artist’s archive. Not without
                    remuneration. I want my work to be paid for. </p>
                    <p>As a freelance artist, I hope to get exposure, recommendation, a name. Not because I like it but
                    because I need the money. I help friends and friends-of-friends with my knowledge and my tools. Not
                    because they will give me anything in return but because it’s what I have in abundance. I prepare
                    and study subjects that may be fruitful for a future project. Not to entice potential investors but
                    because this work is my passion. But I don’t want to ask everyone if they might perhaps offer me a
                    donation, and exhibit art in gallerys where nobody buys it, and give the same technical support over
                    and over, and stay with a rotting pile of artworks. Not for free. </p>
                    <p>As a freelance artist, I will survive. I have loving friends and family that will always share with
                    me what they have. But that’s a dog’s life! I am anxious because I am earning too little. I am
                    anxious because my brain is constantly calculating how much I can spend and which client I must
                    remind to pay me. I am anxious because the philantrophic institutions don’t care for my everyday
                    life problems, and they won’t pay me the money that I already spent if anything goes wrong.</p>
                    <p>Fuck the gallery. Fuck the state. Fuck the philantrophic sociopath threefold. Just give me money so I
                    don’t need to think about money any more.</p>
