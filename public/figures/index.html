<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
<p><em>July:</em> Respond to this invitation and take an interview with
me to <strong>collect our needs, desires and curiosities</strong></p>
<p><em>End of July:</em> <strong>Seed camp.</strong> Everyone is
welcome. We’ll find some spots for camping and organise water, food,
transportation etc.</p>
<p><em>August:</em> One week of camping, witchcraft, curious play,
cooking, sound recording, storytelling, shapeshifting, filmmaking. Like
on a Rainbow gathering, “if you see a job, it’s yours”. We commit to
<strong>consent</strong> wihtin our shifting boundaries, to mutual
<strong>care</strong> and self-care, and to make the space as
<strong>accessible</strong> for all of us as we can. No drugs except if
needed for medical reasons.</p>
<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>

<h3 id="connecting-with-the-fight-against-extractivism">Connecting with
the fight against extractivism</h3>
</summary>
<p>For the past 10 years, Hambi has been occupied – as the coal
strip-mining moonscape is swallowing the ancient forest. I’m curious
about the stories of resistance, failure, connection and extraction that
we may find there. And I see our intuitive and creative approach as part
of the liberatory struggle against enclosures.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h3 id="exploring-boundaries-edges-shells">Exploring boundaries, edges,
shells</h3>
</summary>
<p>Between incompatible systems, there is always a strange boundary
layer, where concepts from either space stop making sense. At Hambi,
there is the coal-mine which is all about violent and useless
extraction, policing and enclosure, directly next to a beautiful
ecosystem that includes the occupiers. What is in-between? What kinds of
stories do trees, grains of sands, puddles of water tell that have lost
their connection to either side?</p>
<p>There is a similar thing going on between bodies: Where one ends and
the other begins, there is no defining narrative, only matter and
possible stories. Through embodies consent-exercises, we will embrace
and cultivate these boundaries, and find which unknown stories they
contain. At the edges, our bodies transform into other beings. We will
lose our old shells and grow new ones, improvise and encounter each
other.</p>
<p>This is an invitation for everyone to find these juicy boundaries.
It’s really the opposite of “normal”. Let’s embrace and celebrate that
we don’t have the proper words to descibe ourselves or where we are!</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h3 id="embodying-figures">Embodying figures</h3>
</summary>
<p>Through open play and acute observation, we develop and embody
“figures”. You can think of a figure as a major arcanum in Tarot (The
Sun, The Pope, The Lovers…) or as any animal or plant or concept that
becomes meaningful to us. By playing and living with each other in the
body of a figure, we stretch our collective imagination.</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>We embody these figures while cooking, walking around, resting.</li>
<li>We share with each other what we observe</li>
<li>We tune our figures to what we need and desire. When we lose
connection, we find another figure.</li>
</ul>
<p>What mutualities or ideas or conflics arise in the encounters between
the figures? Each day, we will formalize some of these encounters in a
little scene.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h3 id="re-appropriating-the-camera">Re-appropriating the camera</h3>
</summary>
<p>Most images serve the exploitation. Satellite images represent the
globe as a grid of squares fit for ownership and extraction. But I think
the camera can also produce other images, where everything is in
relation to other things. To me, this connects with pre-modern withcraft
practices, alchemy, shapeshifting. We will experiment with the camera as
an apparatus that transforms a pyramid-shaped space into a flat, moving
image which then stands next to the whole collective audiovisual
memory.</p>
<p>Instead of planning an image or a narrative top-down, we’ll focus on
the relations that we find between the figures. We will remain aware of
the camera and step in and out of the frame. Each day, we will film a
small scene and learn how to center relations in an image.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h3 id="making-sanctuary">Making sanctuary</h3>
</summary>
<p>I hate the image of apocalypse. How nature, indigineity, femininity,
peace are imagined as a passive victims, doomed. There are so many other
archetypes and images for resistance, abundance, connection, diversity.
There are so many other ways to relate. One is the <em>sanctuary</em>: a
protected space where we find refuge and power-with.</p>
<p>Before everything, this gathering is a time for us to co-regulate,
care for each other, grieve and celebrate, learn and teach, take it
slow, and say no to what doesn’t serve us any more!</p>
</details>
<h2 id="what-came-before">What came before</h2>
<p>My inspiration comes from many retreats and workshops I organised or
took part in: Rainbow gatherings, Butoh dance, Bouffon practice (“dark
clowning”), Counterpoint improvised singing, Contact improvisation.
Specifically, I will bring the following practices to the gathering:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><strong>Limit jam.</strong> This is a collective, non-verbal
exploration of boundaries with touch, in motion.</li>
<li><strong>Ad hoc witchcraft rituals.</strong> I love to invent little
rituals that structure our activities and help us tune in to each other
and to the world around us.</li>
<li><strong>Agency of sadness.</strong> Space for grieving,
storytelling, joy and letting go. <a
href="https://tiny.cc/sadness">Link</a></li>
<li><strong>Fantastic figures in the Shellcapes.</strong> Last year, we
went to a former military base in east germany and explored our
collective body, play, boundaries, and imaginary creatures. <a
href="https://flupsi.com/#fantastic">Link</a></li>
<li><strong>Shells.</strong> <a
href="https://flupsi.com/multimedia/#Shell">Link</a></li>
<li><strong>Counter-hegemonial Filmmaking.</strong> Deploying allegory
and the camera-magic (“photogenie”) against the grain.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What are your practices and experiences that you feel like
bringing to the gathering?</em></p>
<h2 id="how-to-join">How to join</h2>
<p>Does this invitation speak to you? Take an interview with Flupsi
(upsiflu@gmail.com) to find out more, and to share your needs, desires
and curiosities. Then you can decide if you want to commit. We will find
a time where we are all available. Join the seed-camp in the end of July
if you have the capacity.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tell me if you are interested, even if you are not able to join in
August. We will make many more such gatherings.</p>
